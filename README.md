# Project Generator
This is an unfinished project, but I am making this to play around more with Puppeteer (Headless webscraper). This Project
will allow the user to type in their GitHub information and the webscraper will make a use less commit for them. This is made
to generate a free green dot on the users profile for that day. I do not reccomend users to use this, I am making this for
primarily education purposes for me.
